Architecture
One paragraph-ish:

_Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:_

_Describe assembly language and machine language:_

machine language is raw binary code use by computer to process step by step commands. This is the language computers understand, however it is harder for humans to read.
Assembly language is level higher and is more readable than machine, acts as a go between the human and the computer. Then an assembler translates the assembly code into machine code to be used by the computer.

_Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:_

by "watching" the movements of things the machine learns the algorithm of what it is "seeing". It is learning the process of how something happens. For instance how a picture is drawn to a screen. What pixels are changed, and in what order and color. After many images it begins to reconize what the image is and how to draw the image. More amazing it begins to recognize the real live version of what was an image, sort of like a child reading about and drawing a picture of a lion, then going to the zoo and seeing a real lion.
